Nothing should be ignored in this case. The changes consist only of Python source files (`.py`), which are core project files that should be tracked in version control. There are no build artifacts, dependency directories, temporary files, or other items that typically warrant being added to `.gitignore`.

The current `.gitignore` content is empty, and no new ignore rules are needed based on the provided file changes.
